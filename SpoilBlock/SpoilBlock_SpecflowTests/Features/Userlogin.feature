Feature: User Logins

**As a registered user I would like to be able to login to SpoilBlock website so I am be able to search for shows and add my choices to my watchlist.**

This feature ensures that users who have previously registered can successfully login and see a personalized message
that confirms they are recognized by the application and logged in.

The steps we define here can be re-used when testing the *register* feature.
