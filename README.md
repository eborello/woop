## **Project Info**
**Spoil Block** provides you with a spoiler-free YouTube experience tailored to your specific watchlist.  
Select which movies or TV shows you are currently watching and/or would like to avoid spoilers for  
and the Spoil Block Chrome extension will blur the title and thumbnail of YouTube videos associated  
with said shows.
